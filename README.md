projects includes dynamic Dashboard made using Excel and other objectives are mentioned below 

OBJECTIVE 1: PREPARE THE DATA FOR ANALYSIS

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the data. How many transactions were recorded, over what period of time? What products and product categories were sold?

Add a new column to calculate Revenue (price * quantity)

Add new columns to calculate Month and Day of Week based on the transaction date
(BONUS: display them as text (i.e. "Jan", "Feb", "Sun", "Mon"), instead of numerical values)

Add a new column to extract Hour from the transaction time


OBJECTIVE 2: EXPLORE THE DATA WITH PIVOT TABLES

Insert a PivotTable on a new tab to show revenue by month

Add two more PivotTables (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by day of week and by hour of day 

Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by product category, sorted descending by transactions

Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions and revenue by product type, sorted descending and filtered to the Top 15 (by transactions)


OBJECTIVE 3: BUILD A DYNAMIC DASHBOARD

Add Pivot Charts to show revenue by month as a line chart, transactions by day of week and hour of day as column charts, and transactions by product category as a bar chart

Assemble the charts into a rough dashboard layout, and include space for the PivotTable showing Top 5 product types (you can design your own layout, or follow the solution)

Add a slicer for Days , Months , and connect it to all of the PivotTables on the sheet

Adjust formatting, alignment, and polish to finalize the dashboard (TIP: hide the raw PivotTables and remove the worksheet gridlines!)

Do you notice any interesting patterns or trends? What recommendations might you offer to improve Maven Roasters operations?
