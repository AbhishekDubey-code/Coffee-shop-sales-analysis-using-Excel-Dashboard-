# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Using Excel Dashboard

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of coffee shop sales data using Microsoft Excel to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard. The dashboard provides insights into sales performance, transaction patterns, and product popularity, helping to identify key trends and areas for improvement. The project is structured around three main objectives: data preparation, data exploration using PivotTables, and building a dynamic dashboard.

## Project Overview

The main goals of this project are to:

1. **Prepare the data for analysis** by cleaning, organizing, and adding relevant calculations.
2. **Explore the data** using Excel PivotTables to summarize sales performance and identify key metrics.
3. **Build a dynamic dashboard** to visualize the data, making it easy to understand and interact with.

## Objectives

### OBJECTIVE 1: Prepare the Data for Analysis

To begin, the sales data is prepared by performing the following steps:

- **Data Familiarization:** Understand the dataset by determining the number of transactions recorded, the period over which the data was collected, and the different products and categories sold.
  
- **Revenue Calculation:** Add a new column to calculate the revenue for each transaction using the formula `Revenue = Price * Quantity`.
  
- **Date and Time Features:** 
  - Add new columns to calculate the month and day of the week from the transaction date. For better readability, these are displayed as text (e.g., "Jan", "Feb", "Sun", "Mon") rather than numerical values.
  - Extract the hour from the transaction time to analyze sales by time of day.

### OBJECTIVE 2: Explore the Data with PivotTables

Using PivotTables, we summarize and explore the sales data to uncover important insights:

- **Monthly Revenue:** Create a PivotTable on a new tab to display revenue by month, allowing for a clear view of sales trends over time.
  
- **Transactions by Day and Hour:** Add two additional PivotTables on the same sheet to show the number of transactions by the day of the week and by the hour of the day, helping to identify peak sales periods.
  
- **Product Category Analysis:** Develop a PivotTable to display the number of transactions by product category, sorted in descending order of transactions to highlight the most popular categories.
  
- **Top Product Types:** Create a PivotTable to display the number of transactions and revenue by product type, sorted in descending order and filtered to show the Top 15 products by transactions. This helps in identifying best-selling products.

### OBJECTIVE 3: Build a Dynamic Dashboard

The final step involves building a dynamic dashboard that presents the data in a user-friendly and interactive format:

- **Visualize Key Metrics:** 
  - Add Pivot Charts to show revenue by month as a line chart.
  - Display transactions by day of the week and hour of the day as column charts.
  - Use a bar chart to visualize transactions by product category.
  
- **Dashboard Layout:** Assemble these charts into a cohesive dashboard layout, including space for a PivotTable showing the Top 15 product types. This layout can be customized based on specific needs or using a suggested design.
  
- **Interactive Features:** Add slicers for filtering by days, months, and store locations, making it easier for users to explore the data from different perspectives.
  
- **Final Touches:** Adjust the formatting, alignment, and overall presentation of the dashboard to enhance clarity and professionalism. This includes hiding raw PivotTables and removing worksheet gridlines for a cleaner look.

### Additional Analysis

In addition to the main objectives, other useful charts and analyses have been included to provide a broader view of the sales data. These additional visualizations help in identifying patterns and trends that may not be immediately apparent.

## Conclusion

This Excel dashboard project provides valuable insights into the sales operations of a coffee shop. By analyzing sales data through PivotTables and dynamic visualizations, it becomes possible to make data-driven decisions to optimize performance and improve operations. Key patterns, such as peak sales times and popular products, are highlighted, offering recommendations for enhancing business strategies.
